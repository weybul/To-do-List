# To-do-List
This is perhaps as oringinal a version of to do list as you will find there, it was my first project that i built using tkinter. i had enough fun making it own my own. its much better
to go and start building things own ur own rather then doing by watching tutorials. u still will need help and for me it was chatgpt. if it wasnt for chatgpt i would have had to go and 
first watch tutorials learn from there and i did watch like mayb 4 or five but i honestly hate watching tutorials. so after learning the very basics of tkinter like drawing an image on
the screen or setting up a window. i gave up on tutorials i will chatgpt for any thing i had doubts implementing myself and then read th code it gave me/practice it tried to grab the logic
untill i was able to implement it myself, there werea lot of times where it's suggested code introduced me to errors in my program and i just had to debugg it again i will take chatgpt's
help for any quick fixes but mostly there weren't, thing with chatgpt is it can give u all the code in the world but its almost never error free, but im happy that it existed so i dint have
to put meself through the pain of watchin tutorials/courses etc, and that i was able to grow and build something on my own while learning throughout. over all this was my the 1st project
that had a gui aspect to it that i built on my own and it was fun.
